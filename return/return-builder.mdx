api: 'Constructs and returns a standardized response object'

### Introduction

The `Return` utility function constructs and returns a standardized response object. This utility ensures consistency in response structures across different operations, making it easier to handle and log responses. It includes metadata such as:

- **Success status** of the operation.
- **Descriptive message** for the response.
- **Optional data payload.**
- **Timestamp** indicating when the response was generated.

Additionally, the function provides optional logging capabilities that are influenced by the provided parameters and the environment configuration.

---

### Parameters

The function accepts a single parameter object with the following keys:

- **`data`** *(any, optional)*: The data to include in the response. Defaults to `null`.
- **`success`** *(boolean, optional)*: Indicates whether the operation was successful. Defaults to `false`.
- **`function_name`** *(string, optional)*: The name of the function generating the response. Defaults to an empty string (`''`).
- **`message`** *(string, required)*: A descriptive message about the operation. This parameter is required.
- **`console_log`** *(boolean, optional)*: If `true`, logs the response to the console. Defaults to `false`.
- **`error`** *(boolean, optional)*: If `true`, indicates that the response represents an error. Defaults to `false`.

---

### Return Value

The function returns a standardized response object with the following structure:

- **`success`** *(boolean)*: Indicates whether the operation was successful. If `error` is `true`, this field is always `false`.
- **`message`** *(string)*: A descriptive message about the operation. If `function_name` is provided, it prefixes the message with the function name.
- **`data`** *(any)*: The data included in the response. Defaults to `null`.
- **`time`** *(number)*: A Unix timestamp (in seconds) representing the response's creation time.

---

### Logging Behavior

The function provides conditional logging:

1. **`console_log` is `true`:**
   - If `error` is `true`, the response is logged as an error (`console.error`).
   - If the environment is not production (`env !== 'prod'`), the response is logged to the console (`console.log`).

2. **`console_log` is `false`:** No logging occurs.

### Import 

```ts 
import { Return } from '@/utils/return';
```


### Example Usage

Below are some examples demonstrating how to use the `Return` utility function.

#### Example 1: Successful Response
```javascript
const response = Return({
    data: { userId: 123 },
    success: true,
    function_name: 'getUserData',
    message: 'User data retrieved successfully',
    console_log: true
});

console.log(response);
// Output: Logs response object to console
```

#### Example 2: Error Response
```javascript
const response = Return({
    data: null,
    success: false,
    function_name: 'updateUser',
    message: 'Failed to update user',
    console_log: true,
    error: true
});

console.error(response);
// Output: Logs error response to console
```

#### Example 3: Response in Non-Production Environment
```javascript
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_ENV = 'dev';

const response = Return({
    data: { config: 'debug' },
    success: true,
    function_name: 'getConfig',
    message: 'Configuration fetched',
    console_log: true
});

// Logs response to console because the environment is not production
```
