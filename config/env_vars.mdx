### Env vars
Changing any of these will require a full re-built of the project for changes to render applied.
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_MULTIPLE_SESSION_CHECK=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_IP_IDENTIFICATION=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_MFA=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_AUTO_ROUTE_NEGOTIATION=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBSOCKET=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_BRAND=xylex
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_ALLOW_CREATE_ORGANIZATION=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_SHOW_AUTH_IDX_LABEL=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_ENV=dev
```


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_MULTIPLE_SESSION_CHECK` (bool)
This will control whether or not the session controller will kick any sessions per `user_id` that exceed `1`,

If `user_a` logs in at 1PM, `user_b` then logs in at 2PM but `user_a` is still on it,
it will auto-terminate all the sessions of `user_a` and route them to authenticate the session tokens for `user_b`

Setting this to `false` will mean it is *enabled*, setting this to `true` will mean it is *disabled*

##### Possible values
- `true`
- `false`


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_IP_IDENTIFICATION` (bool)
This will control the GeoLocation identifying per IP address, the IP addresses will still be stored in `audit_log_auth` & `sessions` but no additional data will be minted from the API, and no new `ip_indentities` will be generated by the daemon.

Setting this to `false` will mean it is *enabled*, setting this to `true` will mean it is *disabled*

##### Possible values
- `true`
- `false`


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_MFA` (bool)
This will allow the `XylexProvider` daemon to possibly enforce MFA challenges when deemed necessary. 

MFA can still be turned off by the user itself, or not setup.

Setting this to `false` will mean it is *enabled*, setting this to `true` will mean it is *disabled*

##### Possible values
- `true`
- `false`


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_AUTO_ROUTE_NEGOTIATION` (bool)
This controls the route virtualizer to control post-middleware what routes the user is on relative to the organizational or personal `account_scopes`.

Setting this to `false` will mean it is *enabled*, setting this to `true` will mean it is *disabled*

##### Possible values
- `true`
- `false`


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_DISABLE_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBSOCKET` (bool)
This will allow the realtime websockets to stream into the clients and thus alert when possible notifications have been received, however during high load or testing this could bring massive overloading to the infrastructure.

Setting this to `false` will mean it is *enabled*, setting this to `true` will mean it is *disabled*

##### Possible values
- `true`
- `false`


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_BRAND` (string)
What the domain brand name is set to when building the Bootstrap which is used to render the correct Logo or any mentions of the `XYLEX` brand anywhere.


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_ALLOW_CREATE_ORGANIZATION` (bool)
This controls whether everyone or no one can create a new organization.

Setting this to `true` will mean it is *enabled*, setting this to `false` will mean it is *disabled*

##### Possible values
- `true`
- `false`



### Development environment only flags
#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_SHOW_AUTH_IDX_LABEL` (bool)
Will render a fixed sticky label on the bottom of the screen to show what the current viewport's `AuthIdx` is.

Setting this to `true` will mean it is *enabled*, setting this to `false` will mean it is *disabled*

##### Possible values
- `true`
- `false`


#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_XLX_ENV` (string)
Tells the `IdxLabel` what environment we're currently in, also only works on local. The production build does not have the option to change this.
