### AuthIndexContext
Xylex provider is the context layer that projects down the `authIndex` 

### Header
It renders the complete `NavigationHeader` and `ActionHeader`

### Footer
It also renders the entire `Footer`

### Props
```typescript
export function XylexProvider({
    children,
    migrated_container = false
}: {
    children?: ReactNode,
    migrated_container?: boolean
})
```

#### Migration
`migrated_container` is defaulted to `false` this will `translate-y-[xpx]` down the rendered `children` instead of having to rely on a `contentContainer` to push the children down 

```typescript
{migrated_container ? (
    <div className='translate-y-[145px] sm:px-5'>
        {children}
    </div>
) : (
    children
)}
```
Legacy pages will not use this yet as they are still relying on the `contentContainer` to translate for them.

New pages **SHOULD** use this.
